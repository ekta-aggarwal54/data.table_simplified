A comprehensive guide for data.table library in R

## ***From dplyr to data.table***
Being a dplyr fan I had always been resistant to switch to anything else. But imagine when you had to deal with datasets of millions of rows, waiting for seconds for your filter command to work, waiting for minutes for the joins to work - Trust me! It can really be a big pain (specially when you are working under too harsh deadlines)!

I had head a lot about data.table being the way too quicker and time saving as compared to dplyr but never had the interest in using so.
One day I gave it a try and I could easily observe see the considerable time difference in dplyr and data.table functions.  Obviously data.table won in that league!

That is how I tried to get out of my comfort zone of using only dplyr and tried befriending data.table. :)
